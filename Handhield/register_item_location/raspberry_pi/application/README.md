This app is the interface where we scan barcodes and shelf-values
and runs in the foreground

ItÂ´s main purpose is to validate and store the scanned barcodes

It should be invoked on login via .bashrc or .profile etc.

The daemon that runs in the background will handle the upload of
the scanned barcodes
